/**
 * Semi-lazy node graph implementation.
 *
 * The actual code is extremely similar to [gg.essential.gui.elementa.state.v2.impl.minimal.MarkThenPullImpl]
 * (originally only a single line difference), however the mechanism by which it functions is not.
 *
 * This implementation operates in three phases:
 * - The first phase propagates a may-be-dirty state to all potentially affected nodes
 * - The second phase goes through all dirty nodes and run the third phase for each of them
 * - The phase phase checks if the given node needs to be updated, recursively. And if so, updates it, marks all its
 *   direct dependents as dirty (to be processed by the second phase), and then returns to the second phase.
 *
 * Unlike [gg.essential.gui.elementa.state.v2.impl.minimal.MarkThenPullImpl], this means that sub-graphs which are
 * potentially affected but whose dependencies have not actually changed, will not be visited (more than once per
 * them actually changing; as opposed to having to re-visit every time they are potentially affected).
 * That does mean that this implementation will in exchange potentially visit intermediate nodes which, by the time
 * they're being visited, do not actually have any effects attached to them any more (hence it only being "semi lazy").
 * However, in practice, non-affected nodes usually vastly outnumber dead intermediate nodes (especially because
 * those are usually garbage collected together with the respective effects that used them) by one to two orders of
 * magnitude, making this well worth it.
 *
 * Furthermore, support has later been added to dynamically unregister such intermediate nodes which no longer have
 * any effects attached to them, which almost completely eliminates the above downside, at the cost of making
 * `getUntracked` more expensive on such nodes when called frequently, and a bit more internal bookkeeping.
